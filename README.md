# WeatherApp

I created this application to learn more about the Blazor framework. It allows the user to type in a zipcode for a given city and see some basic information about the forecast there. It utilizes the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/WeatherAPI-CSharp/0.5.1#show-readme-container">WeatherAPI-CSharp</a> package to call the <a href="https://www.weatherapi.com/">WeatherAPI</a>. The project was also created with clean architecture in mind, hence the project directory structure.

# Getting Started
1. Create a free account at ![WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and get access to your API key.
2. Add a system environment variable with said API key (ensure to name it *API_KEY*), click ![here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/machine-learning/oml4r/1.5.1/oread/creating-and-modifying-environment-variables-on-windows.html) for further directions.
3. Run the application!
